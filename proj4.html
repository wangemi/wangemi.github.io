        <b>LANGUAGE:</b> Java<br>
        <b>CLASS PROJECT:</b> Data Structures & Parallelism<br>
        <b>PARTNER PROJECT</b><br>
        <b>DURATION:</b> 2 weeks<br>

        The zip utility zips given input files. Some accepted formats include PDFs, HTML files,
        and .txt files.<br>

        <br><br>

        <h2>The Focus</h2>
        This project focused on implementing work lists for the backend of the zip utility.
        Some work lists that we coded include LIFO queues, array stack, min-heap, and hash
        trie sets. <br><br>
        This is the first project out of the three for the Data Structures and Parallelism
        class. Code written in this project is built upon in a later project,
        <a href="proj3.html">uMessage</a>.
        <br><br>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <b>— PART 1</b><br>
        For the first part of this project, we implemented work lists such as the queues and
        stacks. For the queues, we had two different implementations — one used a linked list,
        and the other used a circular array.
        <br><br>

        <b>— PART 2</b><br>
        Next, we wrote a min heap as array-based that starts at index 0. Our min heap is a
        four heap with four children per node. We also coded a HashTrieMap and HashTrieSet
        as well.
        <br><br>

        <b>— PART 3</b><br>
        Now that our standard work lists are completed, we ran the provided Zip client code.
        The Zip client used the min heap / PriorityQueue to do the Huffman coding, the FIFO
        queue as the buffer, the stack to calculate the key set of a trie, and the SuffixTrie
        for LZ77Compression.
        <br><br>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        This project was the first project I worked on with a partner. Since I was used to
        trying to solve all of the problems on my own, it was a learning curve. However,
        I found that I really enjoy working with other people! Being able to bounce ideas off
        of each other and talk through potential solutions together was a worthwhile
        experience, and I look forward to more collaborative projects in the future.
