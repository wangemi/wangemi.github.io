            <b>LANGUAGES:</b> Java, Javascript, React, HTML/CSS <br>
            <b>CLASS PROJECT:</b> Software Design & Implementation<br>
            <b>DURATION:</b> 6 weeks<br>
            <b>SPRING 2019</b><br>

            <br>


            Campus Maps is web application that allows students to quickly find the shortest path
            between two buildings on campus. Simply input two buildings of your choice, and
            Campus Maps will show you a visual path (see red line) that you can take! <br>

            <br><br>

            <h2>The Focus</h2>
            The bulk of this project centered around building an effective graph ADT that can
            support a decent amount of data without efficiency loss. <br><br>
            This project also focused on developing pragmatic programming skills, such as
            learning how to properly document code, write programs that are correct,
            easy to modify, understand, and scale. In addition, I learned how to write testing
            code for my graph ADT, and use Javascript, React, and HTML/CSS for the final front
            facing web application.
            <br><br>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <b>— PART 1</b><br>
            First, I specified the API for a directed labeled graph intended to support
            the campus map. I thought about operations my ADT would need, and broke that
            down into classes / interfaces I would need. After writing out the high level
            specification, I proceeded to write the skeleton code of what I would need,
            documenting each class and method stud with Javadoc. <br><br>
            With my skeleton code completed, I then wrote both specification and implementation
            tests. Tests were written before actually implementing the ADT because this allows
            me to know exactly how my code should function prior to implementing it.

            <br><br>

            <b>— PART 2</b><br>
            During the second part of the project, I implemented my graph ADT. I chose
            to use a collection of Edges to represent my graph. I focused primarily on
            maintaining good style and design during the early stages, though I made
            sure my code was still reasonably efficient. I further documented my code
            with abstraction functions and representation invariants to practice pragmatic
            programming.

            <br><br>

            <b>— PART 3</b><br>
            With my completed graph ADT, it was time to test the scalability of my implementation.
            The data provided to me was the how the Marvel universe's characters related to each other,
            and contained thousands of nodes and edges. I fixed any issues that impacted performance
            and efficiency at this stage.

            <br><br>

            <b>— PART 4</b><br>
            Now that my graph ADT runs smoothly and efficiently, I made my graph ADT generic,
            and added the path finding algorithm (Dijkstra's) that would be needed for the
            final web application.

            <br><br>

            <b>— PART 5</b><br>
            The final part of this project was to use Javascript, React, and some HTML/CSS
            to create the front end of the Campus Maps web application. Voila!
            <br><br>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            This was my first "full" project that I completed as a computer science student!
            I learned a lot about how to approach problems in a more structured and organized
            way. In the introductory courses, I tended to just go straight for a solution
            without thinking a lot beforehand, which often resulted in buggy code. In this
            project, by documenting, writing skeleton and test code before actually implementing
            the program allowed me to have a very clear understanding of how my code should
            execute. Thus, my programs ended up less buggy and clearly organized.<br><br>
            I also found coding both the backend and front end of this web application very
            rewarding. After several weeks of just staring at code, I was really excited to be
            able to actually interact with a visual application and see my programs at work.
